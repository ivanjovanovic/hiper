# Hiper - Viper inspired configuration library for Haskell

## Requirements

### Use case

* Simplest, provide defaults. Ask for parsing and return defaults.

### Defaults

* Client can define config type to be read adding type safety to the config
* Client can define which locations should be checked to parse additional configuration

## Design

* Intermediate representation for writing to and reading from in a type safe way.

## Resources

* Type safe config - https://hackage.haskell.org/package/deiko-config-0.5.0.0/docs/Data-Config.html
* Configurator - Bryan O'Sullivan https://github.com/bos/configurator
